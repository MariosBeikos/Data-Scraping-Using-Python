# Data-Scraping-Using-Python
A data scraping (or web scraping) where it takes meteorological data from "AccuWeather", creates a file and exports maps.
To run this, first you have to run "GetForecast.py" so that it takes the data which is then exported as a .marios file (Basically a .txt). Then you can run any of the two .py files to map the data in different ways. 
The only parameter for the "GetForecast.py" file is that around line 8 & 9 the user must insert by hand the link of the city he wishes to map, as well as in the next list the coordinates of the city in the same order as the first list.
For the "CreateInteractiveMap.py" file the user must choose for which of the ten days he wishes to map. Around line 184. The output files have also been placed inside the folder.
